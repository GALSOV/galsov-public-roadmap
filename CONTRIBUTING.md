# Contributing to GALSOV (Public Roadmap Repo)

Thanks for taking an interest in GALSOV — it genuinely helps.

This repository is **roadmap-only** (planning, progress, discussions). The engine source code and production assets are currently private while v0.1 is being implemented for commercial release.

## What to use this repo for

### ✅ Great contributions
- Bug reports from public builds (when available)
- Feature requests / quality-of-life suggestions
- Balance or UX ideas (clearly framed as suggestions)
- Questions about the roadmap or design intent
- Proof-reading public docs (typos, clarity, contradictions)

### ❌ Please don’t submit
- Decompiled / reverse-engineered code or assemblies
- Game assets extracted from builds (textures, audio, data files)
- Anything that looks like leaked source, internal tools, keys, tokens, or credentials
- “Here’s a clone of your game/source” style content

If something sensitive comes up, please **don’t post it publicly**. Use the contact address below instead.

## How to file an Issue (the useful kind)

When creating an Issue, please include:

1. **Summary**  
   One sentence: what’s wrong / what you want.

2. **Type**  
   Bug / Feature / UX / Balance / Question

3. **Context**  
   - What you were trying to do  
   - What you expected to happen  
   - What actually happened

4. **Repro steps (for bugs)**  
   1) …  
   2) …  
   3) …

5. **Evidence (optional but helpful)**  
   Screenshots, logs, or short clips *without* any extracted assets or decompiled code.

6. **Environment (for bugs)**  
   - Windows version  
   - GPU/CPU (optional)  
   - Any relevant settings

## Suggestions vs “must-have”
This project ships by milestone. Feature ideas are welcome, but please assume:
- If it’s not required for the current milestone, it may go into a **v0.2 candidate** list.
- “Cool but risky” is often postponed until the engine foundation is stable.

## Code contributions
At this stage, this repo does not accept engine/source contributions (the codebase is private).  
If you’re interested in collaborating later, open an Issue tagged **Collaboration** describing what you’d like to do.

## Community expectations
Be respectful. Be curious. Assume good intent.  
Strong opinions are fine; personal attacks are not.
